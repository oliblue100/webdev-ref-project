  <h1>HTML Reference Page</h1>
  <h2>Use this page to refer back to if you need a refresher.</h2>
  <p>
    Sometimes when working on a project, its easy to forget how to use different features. Especially having to learn multiple languages like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
    While they all work together, its hard to memorize everything. The sheer amount of features available is enourmous, its impossible to memorize everything. Even some
    basic features are hard to memorize. Personally, although I've been developing for quite some time, I still forget how to link a basic stylesheet. (<i>"Its not 'url', its 'href!!!'"</i>)
    This is a somewhat of an HTML cheatsheet that you can use to refer back to incase I need to refresh my memory on how different features work.</p>

    Be sure to look at html source! There are comments there that provide more detailed information.

  <h3>Here's an example of how this page may be used:</h3>
  <div>
    <h2>CSS Grids</h2>
    <h3>Here we see a basic CSS grid:</h3>
    <div class="grid text-align-center apply-grid-main-style" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; width:400px">
      <div><b>Item 1</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 2</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 3</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 4</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 5</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 6</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 7</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 8</b></div>
    </div>

    <br>



    <h3>
      Some grid properties must be applied to the grid container. for example, we can set the gap size. We can also specify the grid gap to be rows or columns.
      As you can see, the row gap is smaller than the column gap:
    </h3>
    <div class="grid text-align-center apply-grid-main-style" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; width:400px; row-gap: 10px; column-gap: 60px;">
      <div><b>Item 1</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 2</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 3</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 4</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 5</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 6</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 7</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 8</b></div>
    </div>

    <h3>
      Other grid properties must be applied to the items themselves. For example, configuring the 8th item to cover the last two spots.
    </h3>
    <div class="grid text-align-center apply-grid-main-style" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; width:400px; ">
      <div><b>Item 1</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 2</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 3</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 4</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 5</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 6</b></div>
      <div><b>Item 7</b></div>
      <!--
        It might sound reversed, but when we make an element span across a row, we need to set the column-start and column-end property.
        And if you need the element to span across the columns, its the row-start and row-end property that needs to be applied. It might be
        difficult to wrap your head around, but when you think about it it makes sense. In the following example, we're not really expanding 
        your grid item to fill in more space in the row, we're allowing it to fit into extra columns.
      -->
      <div style="grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end:4"><b>Item 8</b></div>
    </div>



    <h3>
      Using grid-template-area, we can configure our grid exactly as we want, though it does mean our code might be a little more cluttered:
    </h3>
    <!--
    A note here. Grid area gives us a lot of control but can also cause the most confusion. In this case, we need to add a grid-area name to 
    every single grid item in order to tell the grid container where exactly to place each item. Otherwise, problems can occur. grid-areas can
    be used for single grid-items, to specify exactly how many columns and rows they should take. But without the proper configuration, the order
    of grid items can break.

    Configuring the style and placement of grid items usually just requires lof of trial and error.

      <div style="grid-area: item1;"><b>Item 1</b></div>
